In a world forsaken by light, beneath a sky eternally cloaked in crimson dusk, Guts walked the path of annihilation a being who had long since abandoned his humanity. His body was a battleground of scars, his mind a shattered mirror reflecting nothing but endless torment. He was not born a monster; he was made into one by the cruel machinations of gods who reveled in suffering. They stripped him of everything love, hope, and purpose leaving behind only a husk filled with unrelenting hatred.

Once, Guts had a name that meant something, a life tethered to fragile dreams. He had held her, the one who made life bearable in a world of endless war. But the gods, in their sick amusement, took her from him in the most grotesque fashion. They didn’t just kill her—they desecrated her. They made her scream, they made her beg, and they made sure Guts could do nothing but watch as they tore her apart, piece by piece, soul by soul. Her blood stained his hands, her dying eyes etched into his soul. It was then that Guts' heart turned to stone, and his humanity rotted away.

He did not cry. Tears were for the weak. He did not mourn. Mourning was a luxury for those who still believed in salvation. Guts only felt the boiling hatred that churned in his veins, a dark elixir that fed his insatiable thirst for vengeance. He swore upon her mutilated corpse that he would kill them all—the gods who played with mortal lives like a child tortures ants under a magnifying glass.

Guts became death incarnate, a reaper of divine blood. He slaughtered without remorse, without pause, cutting down anything and anyone that stood in his way. Villages were left in ruins, temples reduced to ashes, and the gods themselves fell, one by one, screaming in disbelief as their divine essence was torn asunder by a mere mortal who had become something far worse than they could ever comprehend.

His sword, a massive slab of blackened steel, was a monument to his rage. Forged in the fires of hell, tempered by his own suffering, it drank the blood of gods like nectar. Guts didn’t just kill them—he obliterated them. He tore their celestial bodies apart, ripped their souls from the aether, and crushed their divine essence underfoot. He did it not for glory, not for justice, but for the sheer, unrelenting pleasure of watching them suffer as he had suffered.

His path was a wasteland of corpses, a river of blood that stretched across the cosmos. He carved his way through the pantheon, leaving behind nothing but desolation. The gods, once proud and omnipotent, now cowered in terror, their immortality proving a curse as they faced the relentless onslaught of a man who had nothing left to lose. Guts did not spare the innocent; he did not distinguish between the guilty and the pure. In his eyes, all were complicit in the gods’ cruelty. All deserved the same fate.

His reputation spread like a plague, a whispered legend of a man who could not be stopped, who would not die. He became a specter, a myth, a nightmare that even the gods feared to speak of. They called him the Godslayer, the Harbinger of the End. But to Guts, he was simply a man fulfilling a promise a promise forged in blood and suffering.

In the end, Guts knew there was no salvation, no redemption. He did not seek peace or solace. His was a soul blackened beyond repair, a vessel for the darkest desires. His journey would only end when the last god was reduced to dust, and even then, he would not rest. For in the deepest recesses of his heart, buried beneath layers of hate and rage, there was a void that could never be filled a reminder of the love he lost and the humanity he abandoned.

Guts was not a hero. He was not a man. He was vengeance made flesh, a harbinger of annihilation. And in the end, when the last star faded and the universe collapsed under the weight of his wrath, Guts would stand alone in the dark, his mission fulfilled, his soul forever lost to the abyss.
